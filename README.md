## TV Script Generation

In this project, I generate a new Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs using a part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. This Neural Network generates a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

The data can be found here: [Moes Tavern Scripts](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/tv-script-generation/data/simpsons)
